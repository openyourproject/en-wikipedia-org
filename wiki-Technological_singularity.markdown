# Technological singularity

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

 Jump to: [navigation][2], [search][3]

 

The **technological singularity** is the hypothetical future emergence of greater-than-human 
[superintelligence][4] through technological means.[[1]][5] Since the capabilities 
of such intelligence would be difficult for an unaided human mind to comprehend, 
the occurrence of a technological singularity is seen as an intellectual [event 
horizon][6], beyond which events cannot be predicted or understood.

Proponents of the singularity typically state that an "intelligence explosion",[[2]][7][[3]][8] 
where superintelligences design successive generations of increasingly powerful 
minds, might occur very quickly and might not stop until the agent's cognitive 
abilities greatly surpass that of any human.

The term was coined by science fiction writer [Vernor Vinge][9], who argues 
that [artificial intelligence][10], [human biological enhancement][11] or [brain-computer 
interfaces][12] could be possible causes of the singularity. The concept was 
popularized by futurists like [Ray Kurzweil][13] and it is expected by proponents 
to occur sometime in the 21st century, although estimates vary.

[[edit][34]] Basic concepts

[![][35]][36]

[![][37]][36]

[Kurzweil][13] writes that, due to [paradigm shifts][38], a trend of exponential growth extends [Moore's law][39] from [integrated circuits][40] to earlier [transistors][41], [vacuum tubes][42], [relays][43], and [electromechanical][44] computers. He predicts that the exponential growth will continue, and that in a few decades the computing power of all computers will exceed that of human brains, with superhuman [artificial intelligence][10] appearing around the same time.

Many of the most recognized writers on the singularity, such as Vernor Vinge 
and Ray Kurzweil, define the concept in terms of the technological creation 
of superintelligence, and argue that it is difficult or impossible for present-day 
humans to predict what a post-singularity would be like, due to the difficulty 
of imagining the intentions and capabilities of superintelligent entities.[[4]][45][[5]][46][[6]][47] 
The term "technological singularity" was originally coined by Vinge, who made 
an analogy between the breakdown in our ability to predict what would happen 
after the development of superintelligence and the breakdown of the predictive 
ability of modern [physics][48] at the [space-time singularity][49] beyond 
the event horizon of a [black hole][50].[[6]][47]

Some writers use "the singularity" in a broader way to refer to any radical 
changes in our society brought about by new technologies such as [molecular 
nanotechnology][51],[[7]][52][[8]][53][[9]][54] although Vinge and other prominent 
writers specifically state that without superintelligence, such changes would 
not qualify as a true singularity.[[4]][45] Many writers also tie the singularity 
to observations of exponential growth in various technologies (with [Moore's 
Law][55] being the most prominent example), using such observations as a basis 
for predicting that the singularity is likely to happen sometime within the 
21st century.[[8]][53][[10]][56]

A technological singularity includes the concept of an intelligence explosion, 
a term coined in 1965 by [I. J. Good][57].[[11]][58] Although technological 
progress has been accelerating, it has been limited by the basic intelligence 
of the human brain, which has not, according to [Paul R. Ehrlich][59], changed 
significantly for millennia.[[12]][60] However with the increasing power of 
computers and other technologies, it might eventually be possible to build 
a machine that is more intelligent than humanity.[[13]][61] If superhuman intelligences 
were invented, either through the [amplification of human intelligence][62] 
or artificial intelligence, it would bring to bear greater problem-solving 
and inventive skills than humans, then it could design a yet more capable machine, 
or re-write its source code to become more intelligent. This more capable machine 
could then go on to design a machine of even greater capability. These iterations 
could accelerate, leading to [recursive self improvement][63], potentially 
allowing enormous qualitative change before any upper limits imposed by the 
laws of physics or theoretical computation set in.[[14]][64][[15]][65][[16]][66] 

The exponential growth in computing technology suggested by Moore's Law is 
commonly cited as a reason to expect a singularity in the relatively near future, 
and a number of authors have proposed generalizations of Moore's Law. Computer 
scientist and futurist [Hans Moravec][67] proposed in a 1998 book that the 
exponential growth curve could be extended back through earlier computing technologies 
prior to the [integrated circuit][68]. Futurist Ray Kurzweil postulates a [law 
of accelerating returns][69] in which the speed of technological change (and 
more generally, all evolutionary processes[[17]][70]) increases exponentially, 
generalizing Moore's Law in the same manner as Moravec's proposal, and also 
including material technology (especially as applied to [nanotechnology][71]), 
medical technology and others.[[18]][72] Like other authors, though, he reserves 
the term "singularity" for a rapid increase in intelligence (as opposed to 
other technologies), writing for example that "The Singularity will allow us 
to transcend these limitations of our biological bodies and brains ... There 
will be no distinction, post-Singularity, between human and machine".[[19]][73] 
He also defines his predicted date of the singularity (2045) in terms of when 
he expects computer-based intelligences to significantly exceed the sum total 
of human brainpower, writing that advances in computing before that date "will 
not represent the Singularity" because they do "not yet correspond to a profound 
expansion of our intelligence."[[20]][74]

The term "technological singularity" reflects the idea that such change may 
happen suddenly, and that it is difficult to predict how such a new world would 
operate.[[21]][75][[22]][76] It is unclear whether an intelligence explosion 
of this kind would be beneficial or harmful, or even an [existential threat][77],[[23]][78][[24]][79] 
as the issue has not been dealt with by most [artificial general intelligence][80] 
researchers, although the topic of [friendly artificial intelligence][81] is 
investigated by the [Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence][82] 
and the [Future of Humanity Institute][83].[[21]][75]

Many prominent technologists and academics dispute the plausibility of a technological 
singularity, including [Jeff Hawkins][84], [John Holland][85], [Jaron Lanier][86], 
and [Gordon Moore][87], whose Moore's Law is often cited in support of the 
concept.[[25]][88][[26]][89]

## 
[[edit][90]] History of the idea

In the middle of the 19th century [Friedrich Engels][91] wrote that science 
moves forward proportionally to the "mass of knowledge" inherited from the 
previous generations, he proposed a more formal mathematical concept that, 
since the 16th century, the development of the sciences had been increasing 
proportionally to the squared distance in time from its start.[_[citation needed][92]_] 

In 1847, R. Thornton, the editor of _The Expounder of Primitive Christianity_,[[27]][93] 
wrote about the recent invention of a four function [mechanical calculator][94]: 

> 
> ...such machines, by which the scholar may, by turning a crank, grind out the 
> solution of a problem without the fatigue of mental application, would by its 
> introduction into schools, do incalculable injury. But who knows that such 
> machines when brought to greater perfection, may not think of a plan to remedy 
> all their own defects and then grind out ideas beyond the ken of mortal mind! 
> 

In 1951, [Alan Turing][95] spoke of machines outstripping humans intellectually:[[28]][96]

> our feeble powers. ... At some stage therefore we should have to expect the

> 

In 1958, [Stanisław Ulam][99] wrote in reference[[29]][100] to a conversation 
with [John von Neumann][101]:

> 
> One conversation centered on the ever accelerating progress of technology and 
> changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching 
> some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs,

> 

In 1965, I. J. Good first wrote of an "intelligence explosion", suggesting 
that if machines could even slightly surpass human intellect, they could improve 
their own designs in ways unforeseen by their designers, and thus [recursively][102] 
augment themselves into far greater intelligences. The first such improvements 
might be small, but as the machine became more intelligent it would become 
better at becoming more intelligent, which could lead to a cascade of self-improvements 
and a sudden surge to superintelligence (or a singularity).

In 1983, mathematician and author Vernor Vinge greatly popularized Good’s notion 
of an intelligence explosion in a number of writings, first addressing the 
topic in print in the January 1983 issue of _[Omni][103]_ magazine. In this 
op-ed piece, Vinge seems to have been the first to use the term "singularity" 
in a way that was specifically tied to the creation of intelligent machines,[[30]][104][[31]][105] 
writing:

> 
> We will soon create intelligences greater than our own. When this happens, 
> human history will have reached a kind of singularity, an intellectual transition 
> as impenetrable as the knotted space-time at the center of a black hole, and 
> the world will pass far beyond our understanding. This singularity, I believe, 
> already haunts a number of science-fiction writers. It makes realistic extrapolation 
> to an interstellar future impossible. To write a story set more than a century 
> hence, one needs a nuclear war in between ... so that the world remains intelligible. 
> 

In 1984, [Samuel R. Delany][106] used "cultural fugue" as a plot device in 
his science fiction novel _[Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand][107]_; 
the terminal runaway of technological and cultural complexity in effect destroys 
all life on any world on which it transpires, a process which is poorly understood 
by the novel's characters, and against which they seek a stable defense. In 
1985 [Ray Solomonoff][108] introduced the notion of "infinity point"[[32]][109] 
in the time scale of artificial intelligence, analyzed the magnitude of the 
"[future shock][110]" that "we can expect from our AI expanded scientific community" 
and on social effects. Estimates were made "for when these milestones would 
occur, followed by some suggestions for the more effective utilization of the 
extremely rapid technological growth that is expected."

Vinge also popularized the concept in SF novels such as _[Marooned in Realtime][111]_ 
(1986) and _[A Fire Upon the Deep][112]_ (1992). The former is set in a world 
of rapidly [accelerating change][113] leading to the emergence of more and 
more sophisticated technologies separated by shorter and shorter time intervals, 
until a point beyond human comprehension is reached. The latter starts with 
an imaginative description of the evolution of a superintelligence passing 
through exponentially accelerating developmental stages ending in a [transcendent][114], 
almost [omnipotent][115] power unfathomable by mere humans. It is also implied 
that the development does not stop at this level.

In his 1988 book _Mind Children_, computer scientist and futurist Hans Moravec 
generalizes Moore's law to make predictions about the future of artificial 
life. Moravec outlines a timeline and a scenario in this regard,[[33]][116][[34]][117] 
in that the robots will evolve into a new series of artificial species, starting 
around 2030-2040.[[35]][118] In _Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind_, 
published in 1998, Moravec further considers the implications of evolving [robot 
intelligence][119], generalizing Moore's law to technologies predating the 
[integrated circuit][68], and speculating about a coming "mind fire" of rapidly 
expanding superintelligence, similar to Vinge's ideas.

A 1993 article by Vinge, "The Coming Technological Singularity: How to Survive 
in the Post-Human Era",[[4]][45] was widely disseminated on the internet and 
helped to popularize the idea.[[36]][120] This article contains the oft-quoted 
statement, "Within thirty years, we will have the technological means to create 
superhuman intelligence. Shortly after, the human era will be ended." Vinge 
refines his estimate of the time scales involved, adding, "I'll be surprised 
if this event occurs before 2005 or after 2030."

Vinge predicted four ways the singularity could occur:[[37]][121]

1. The development of computers that are "awake" and superhumanly intelligent.
2. Large computer networks (and their associated users) may "wake up" as a superhumanly intelligent entity.
3. Computer/human interfaces may become so intimate that users may reasonably be considered superhumanly intelligent.
4. Biological science may find ways to improve upon the natural human intellect.

Vinge continues by predicting that superhuman intelligences will be able to 
enhance their own minds faster than their human creators. "When greater-than-human 
intelligence drives progress," Vinge writes, "that progress will be much more 
rapid." This [feedback loop][122] of self-improving intelligence, he predicts, 
will cause large amounts of technological progress within a short period, and 
that the creation of superhuman intelligence represented a breakdown in humans' 
ability to model their future. His argument was that authors cannot write realistic 
characters who surpass the human intellect, as the thoughts of such an intellect 
would be beyond the ability of humans to express. Vinge named this event "the 
Singularity".

[Damien Broderick][123]'s [popular science][124] book [The Spike (1997)][125] 
was the first to investigate the technological singularity in detail.

In 2000, [Bill Joy][126], a prominent technologist and founder of [Sun Microsystems][127], 
voiced concern over the potential dangers of the singularity.[[38]][128]

In 2005, Ray Kurzweil published _[The Singularity is Near][129]_, which brought 
the idea of the singularity to the popular media both through the book's accessibility 
and a publicity campaign that included an appearance on _[The Daily Show with 
Jon Stewart][130]_.[[39]][131] The book stirred intense controversy, in part 
because Kurzweil's [utopian][132] predictions contrasted starkly with other, 
darker visions of the possibilities of the singularity. Kurzweil, his theories, 
and the controversies surrounding it were the subject of [Barry Ptolemy][133]'s 
documentary _[Transcendent Man][134]_.

In 2007, [Eliezer Yudkowsky][135] suggested that many of the different definitions 
that have been assigned to "singularity" are mutually incompatible rather than 
mutually supporting.[[8]][53] For example, Kurzweil extrapolates current technological 
trajectories past the arrival of self-improving AI or superhuman intelligence, 
which Yudkowsky argues represents a tension with both I. J. Good's proposed 
discontinuous upswing in intelligence and Vinge's thesis on unpredictability. 

In 2008, [Robin Hanson][136] (taking "singularity" to refer to sharp increases 
in the exponent of economic growth) lists the [Agricultural][137] and [Industrial 
Revolutions][138] as past singularities. Extrapolating from such past events, 
Hanson proposes that the next economic singularity should increase [economic 
growth][139] between 60 and 250 times. An innovation that allowed for the replacement 
of virtually all human labor could trigger this event.[[40]][140]

In 2009, Kurzweil and [X-Prize][141] founder [Peter Diamandis][142] announced 
the establishment of [Singularity University][143], whose stated mission is 
"to assemble, educate and inspire a cadre of leaders who strive to understand 
and facilitate the development of exponentially advancing technologies in order 
to address humanity’s grand challenges."[[41]][144] Funded by [Google][145], 
[Autodesk][146], [ePlanet Ventures][147], and a group of technology industry 
leaders, Singularity University is based at [NASA][148]'s [Ames Research Center][149] 
in [Mountain View][150], [California][151]. The not-for-profit organization 
runs an annual ten-week graduate program during the summer that covers ten 
different technology and allied tracks, and a series of executive programs 
throughout the year.

In 2010 [Aubrey de Grey][152] applied the term the "[Methuselarity][153]"[[42]][154] 
to the point at which medical technology improves so fast that [expected human 
lifespan][155] increases by more than one year per year. In 2010 in "Apocalyptic 
AI - Visions of Heaven in Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, and Virtual Reality"[[43]][156] 
Robert Geraci offers an account of the developing "cyber-theology" inspired 
by Singularity studies. A book exploring some of those themes is the 1996 [Holy 
Fire][157] by Bruce Sterling, which postulates that a Methuselarity will become 
a [gerontocracy][158].

In 2011, Kurzweil noted existing trends and concluded that the singularity 
was becoming more probable to occur around 2045. He told _Time_ magazine: "We 
will successfully reverse-engineer the human brain by the mid-2020s. By the 
end of that decade, computers will be capable of human-level intelligence."[[44]][159] 

## 
[[edit][160]] Intelligence explosion

The notion of an "intelligence explosion" was first described thus by [Good 
(1965][161]), who speculated on the effects of superhuman machines:

> 
> Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass 
> all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design 
> of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine 
> could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an ‘intelligence 
> explosion,’ and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the 
> first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make. 
> 

Most proposed methods for creating superhuman or [transhuman][162] minds fall 
into one of two categories, intelligence amplification of human brains and 
artificial intelligence. The means speculated to produce intelligence augmentation 
are numerous, and include [bioengineering][163], [genetic engineering][164], 
[nootropic][165] drugs, AI assistants, direct brain-computer interfaces and 
[mind uploading][166]. The existence of multiple paths to an intelligence explosion 
makes a singularity more likely; for a singularity to not occur they would 
all have to fail.[[6]][47]

[Hanson (1998][167]) is skeptical of human intelligence augmentation, writing 
that once one has exhausted the "low-hanging fruit" of easy methods for increasing 
human intelligence, further improvements will become increasingly difficult 
to find. Despite the numerous speculated means for amplifying human intelligence, 
non-human artificial intelligence (specifically [seed AI][63]) is the most 
popular option for organizations trying to advance the singularity.[_[citation 
needed][92]_]

Whether or not an intelligence explosion occurs depends on three factors.[[45]][168] 
The first, accelerating factor, is the new intelligence enhancements made possible 
by each previous improvement. Contrariwise, as the intelligences become more 
advanced, further advances will become more and more complicated, possibly 
overcoming the advantage of increased intelligence. Each improvement must be 
able to beget at least one more improvement, on average, for the singularity 
to continue. Finally, there is the issue of a hard upper limit. Absent [quantum 
computing][169], eventually the laws of physics will prevent any further improvements. 

There are two logically independent, but mutually reinforcing, accelerating 
effects: increases in the speed of computation, and improvements to the [algorithms][170] 
used.[[46]][171] The former is predicted by Moore’s Law and the forecast improvements 
in hardware,[[47]][172] and is comparatively similar to previous technological 
advance. On the other hand, most AI researchers believe that software is more 
important than hardware.[_[citation needed][92]_]

### 
[[edit][173]] Speed improvements

The first is the improvements to the speed at which minds can be run. Whether 
human or AI, better hardware increases the rate of future hardware improvements. 
Oversimplified,[[48]][174] Moore's Law suggests that if the first doubling 
of speed took 18 months, the second would take 18 subjective months; or 9 external 
months, whereafter, four months, two months, and so on towards a speed singularity.[[49]][175] 
An upper limit on speed may eventually be reached, although it is unclear how 
high this would be. [Hawkins (2008][176]), responding to Good, argued that 
the upper limit is relatively low;

> 
> Belief in this idea is based on a naive understanding of what intelligence is. As an analogy, imagine we had a computer that could design new computers (chips, systems, and software) faster than itself. Would such a computer lead to infinitely fast computers or even computers that were faster than anything humans could ever build? No. It might accelerate the rate of improvements for a while, but in the end there are limits to how big and fast computers can run. We would end up in the same place; we'd just get there a bit faster. There would be no singularity.  
>  Whereas if it were a lot higher than current human levels of intelligence, the effects of the singularity would be enormous enough as to be indistinguishable (to humans) from a singularity with an upper limit. For example, if the speed of thought could be increased a million-fold, a subjective year would pass in 30 physical seconds.[[6]][47]
> 

It is difficult to directly compare [silicon][177]-based hardware with [neurons][178]. 
But [Berglas (2008][179]) notes that computer [speech recognition][180] is 
approaching human capabilities, and that this capability seems to require 0.01% 
of the volume of the brain. This analogy suggests that modern computer hardware 
is within a few orders of magnitude of being as powerful as the human brain. 

### 
[[edit][181]] Intelligence improvements

Some intelligence technologies, like seed AI, may also have the potential to 
make themselves more intelligent, not just faster, by modifying their [source 
code][182]. These improvements would make further improvements possible, which 
would make further improvements possible, and so on.

This mechanism for an intelligence explosion differs from an increase in speed 
in two ways. First, it does not require external effect: machines designing 
faster hardware still require humans to create the improved hardware, or to 
program factories appropriately. An AI which was rewriting its own source code, 
however, could do so while contained in an [AI box][183].

Second, as with Vernor Vinge’s conception of the singularity, it is much harder 
to predict the outcome. While speed increases seem to be only a quantitative 
difference from human intelligence, actual improvements in intelligence would 
be qualitatively different. Eliezer Yudkowsky compares it to the changes that 
human intelligence brought: humans changed the world thousands of times more 
rapidly than evolution had done, and in totally different ways. Similarly, 
the evolution of life had been a massive departure and acceleration from the 
previous geological rates of change, and improved intelligence could cause 
change to be as different again.[[50]][184]

There are substantial dangers associated with an intelligence explosion singularity. 
First, the goal structure of the AI may not be invariant under self-improvement, 
potentially causing the AI to optimise something other than was intended.[[51]][185][[52]][186] 
Secondly, AIs could compete for the scarce resources mankind uses to survive.[[53]][187] 

While not actively malicious, there is no reason to think that AIs would actively 
promote human goals unless they could be programmed as such, and if not, might 
use the resources currently used to support mankind to promote its own goals, 
causing human extinction.[[10]][56][[54]][188][[55]][189]

### 
[[edit][190]] Impact

Dramatic changes in the rate of economic growth have occurred in the past because 
of some technological advancement. Based on population growth, the economy 
doubled every 250,000 years from the [Paleolithic][191] era until the [Neolithic 
Revolution][137]. This new agricultural economy began to double every 900 years, 
a remarkable increase. In the current era, beginning with the Industrial Revolution, 
the world’s economic output doubles every fifteen years, sixty times faster 
than during the agricultural era. If the rise of superhuman intelligences causes 
a similar revolution, argues Robin Hanson, one would expect the economy to 
double at least quarterly and possibly on a weekly basis.[[40]][140]

#### 
[[edit][192]] Existential risk

[Berglas (2008][179]) notes that there is no direct evolutionary motivation 
for an AI to be friendly to humans. Evolution has no inherent tendency to produce 
outcomes valued by humans, and there is little reason to expect an arbitrary 
optimisation process to promote an outcome desired by mankind, rather than 
inadvertently leading to an AI behaving in a way not intended by its creators 
(such as Nick Bostrom's whimsical example of an AI which was originally programmed 
with the goal of manufacturing paper clips, so that when it achieves superintelligence 
it decides to convert the entire planet into a paper clip manufacturing facility;[[56]][193][[57]][194][[58]][195][Anders 
Sandberg][196] has also elaborated on this scenario, addressing various common 
counter-arguments.[[59]][197]) AI researcher [Hugo de Garis][198] suggests 
that artificial intelligences may simply eliminate the human race for access 
to scarce resources,[[53]][187][[60]][199] and humans would be powerless to 
stop them.[[61]][200] Alternatively, AIs developed under evolutionary pressure 
to promote their own survival could out compete humanity.[[55]][189]

[Bostrom (2002][201]) discusses human extinction scenarios, and lists superintelligence 
as a possible cause:

> 
> When we create the first superintelligent entity, we might make a mistake and 
> give it goals that lead it to annihilate humankind, assuming its enormous intellectual 
> advantage gives it the power to do so. For example, we could mistakenly elevate 
> a subgoal to the status of a supergoal. We tell it to solve a mathematical 
> problem, and it complies by turning all the matter in the solar system into 
> a giant calculating device, in the process killing the person who asked the 
> question.
> 

A significant problem is that unfriendly artificial intelligence is likely 
to be much easier to create than friendly AI. While both require large advances 
in recursive optimisation process design, friendly AI also requires the ability 
to make goal structures invariant under self-improvement (or the AI could transform 
itself into something unfriendly) and a goal structure that aligns with human 
values and does not automatically destroy the human race. An unfriendly AI, 
on the other hand, can optimize for an arbitrary goal structure, which does 
not need to be invariant under self-modification.[[62]][202]

Eliezer Yudkowsky proposed that research be undertaken to produce [friendly 
artificial intelligence][203] in order to address the dangers. He noted that 
the first real AI would have a head start on self-improvement and, if friendly, 
could prevent unfriendly AIs from developing, as well as providing enormous 
benefits to mankind.[[54]][188][Bill Hibbard][204] also addresses issues of 
AI safety and morality in his book _[Super-Intelligent Machines][205]_.

One hypothetical approach towards attempting to control an artificial intelligence 
is an [AI box][183], where the artificial intelligence is kept constrained 
inside a [simulated world][206] and not allowed to affect the external world. 
However, a sufficiently intelligent AI may simply be able to escape by outsmarting 
its less intelligent human captors.[[21]][75][[63]][207][[64]][208]

### 
[[edit][209]] Implications for human society

In 2009, leading computer scientists, artificial intelligence researchers, 
and roboticists met at the Asilomar Conference Grounds near [Monterey Bay][210] 
in California. The goal was to discuss the potential impact of the hypothetical 
possibility that robots could become self-sufficient and able to make their 
own decisions. They discussed the extent to which computers and robots might 
be able to acquire [autonomy][211], and to what degree they could use such 
abilities to pose threats or hazards.

Some machines have acquired various forms of semi-autonomy, including the ability 
to locate their own power sources and choose targets to attack with weapons. 
Also, some [computer viruses][212] can evade elimination and have achieved 
"cockroach intelligence."[_[citation needed][92]_] The conference attendees 
noted that self-awareness as depicted in science-fiction is probably unlikely, 
but that other potential hazards and pitfalls exist.[[65]][213]

Some experts and academics have questioned the use of [robots][214] for military 
combat, especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions.[[66]][215] 
A [United States Navy][216] report indicates that, as military robots become 
more complex, there should be greater attention to implications of their ability 
to make autonomous decisions.[[67]][217][[68]][218]

The [Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence][219] has commissioned 
a study to examine this issue,[[69]][220] pointing to programs like the [Language 
Acquisition Device][221], which can emulate human interaction.

Some support the design of friendly artificial intelligence, meaning that the 
advances which are already occurring with AI should also include an effort 
to make AI intrinsically friendly and humane.[[70]][222]

[Isaac Asimov][223]'s [Three Laws of Robotics][224] is one of the earliest 
examples of proposed safety measures for AI. The laws are intended to prevent 
artificially intelligent robots from harming humans. In Asimov’s stories, any 
perceived problems with the laws tend to arise as a result of a misunderstanding 
on the part of some human operator; the robots themselves are merely acting 
to their best interpretation of their rules. In the [2004][225] film _[I, Robot][226]_, 
loosely based on Asimov's [_Robot_ stories][227], an AI attempts to take complete 
control over humanity for the purpose of protecting humanity from itself due 
to [an extrapolation of the Three Laws][228]. In 2004, the Singularity Institute 
launched an Internet campaign called _3 Laws Unsafe_ to raise awareness of 
AI safety issues and the inadequacy of Asimov’s laws in particular.[[71]][229]

[![][37]][232]

 According to Kurzweil, his [logarithmic graph][233] of 15 lists of [paradigm shifts][38] for key [historic][234] events shows an [exponential][235] trend. The lists' compilers include [Carl Sagan][236][_[citation needed][92]_], [Paul D. Boyer][237], _[Encyclopædia Britannica][238]_, [American Museum of Natural History][239], and [University of Arizona][240]. Click to enlarge.

Main article: [Accelerating change][113]

Some singularity proponents argue its inevitability through extrapolation of 
past trends, especially those pertaining to shortening gaps between improvements 
to technology. In one of the first uses of the term "singularity" in the context 
of technological progress, Stanislaw [Ulam (1958][241]) tells of a conversation 
with [John von Neumann][101] about accelerating change:

> 
> One conversation centered on the ever accelerating progress of technology and 
> changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching 
> some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, 
> as we know them, could not continue.
> 

[Hawkins (1983][242]) writes that "mindsteps", dramatic and irreversible changes 
to paradigms or world views, are accelerating in frequency as quantified in 
his mindstep equation. He cites the inventions of writing, mathematics, and 
the computer as examples of such changes.

Kurzweil's analysis of history concludes that technological progress follows 
a pattern of [exponential growth][235], following what he calls the "[Law of 
Accelerating Returns][243]". Whenever technology approaches a barrier, Kurzweil 
writes, new technologies will surmount it. He predicts [paradigm shifts][38] 
will become increasingly common, leading to "technological change so rapid 
and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history".[[72]][244] 
Kurzweil believes that the singularity will occur before the end of the 21st 
century, setting the [date at 2045][245].[[73]][246] His predictions differ 
from Vinge’s in that he predicts a gradual ascent to the singularity, rather 
than Vinge’s rapidly self-improving superhuman intelligence.

Presumably, a technological singularity would lead to rapid development of 
a [Kardashev Type I civilization][247], one that has achieved mastery of the 
resources of its home planet.[[74]][248]

Oft-cited dangers include those commonly associated with molecular nanotechnology 
and genetic engineering. These threats are major issues for both singularity 
advocates and critics, and were the subject of Bill Joy's _[Wired][249]_ magazine 
article "[Why the future doesn't need us][250]".[[75]][251]

The [Acceleration Studies Foundation][252], an educational non-profit foundation 
founded by [John Smart][253], engages in outreach, education, research and 
advocacy concerning accelerating change.[[76]][254] It produces the Accelerating 
Change conference at Stanford University, and maintains the educational site 
[Acceleration Watch][255].

## 
[[edit][256]] Criticism

Some critics assert that no computer or machine will ever achieve human intelligence, 
while others hold that the definition of intelligence is irrelevant if the 
net result is the same.[[77]][257]

[Steven Pinker][258] stated in 2008,

> 
> "(...) There is not the slightest reason to believe in a coming singularity. 
> The fact that you can visualize a future in your imagination is not evidence 
> that it is likely or even possible. Look at domed cities, jet-pack commuting, 
> underwater cities, mile-high buildings, and nuclear-powered automobiles — all 
> staples of futuristic fantasies when I was a child that have never arrived. 
> Sheer processing power is not a pixie dust that magically solves all your problems. 
> (...)"[[25]][88]
> 

Martin Ford in _The Lights in the Tunnel: Automation, Accelerating Technology 
and the Economy of the Future_[[78]][259] postulates a "technology paradox" 
in that before the singularity could occur most routine jobs in the economy 
would be automated, since this would require a level of technology inferior 
to that of the singularity. This would cause massive unemployment and plummeting 
consumer demand, which in turn would destroy the incentive to invest in the 
technologies that would be required to bring about the Singularity. Job displacement 
is increasingly no longer limited to work traditionally considered to be "routine."[[79]][260] 

[Jared Diamond][261], in _[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed][262]_, 
argues that cultures self-limit when they exceed the sustainable carrying capacity 
of their environment, and the consumption of strategic resources (frequently 
timber, soils or water) creates a deleterious positive feedback loop that leads 
eventually to social collapse and technological retrogression.

[Theodore Modis][263][[80]][264][[81]][265] and [Jonathan Huebner][266][[82]][267] 
argue that the rate of technological innovation has not only ceased to rise, 
but is actually now declining ([John Smart][253], however, criticizes Huebner's 
analysis[[83]][268]). Evidence for this decline is that the rise in computer 
[clock rates][269] is slowing, even while Moore's prediction of exponentially 
increasing circuit density continues to hold. This is due to excessive heat 
build-up from the chip, which cannot be dissipated quickly enough to prevent 
the chip from melting when operating at higher speeds. Advancements in speed 
may be possible in the future by virtue of more power-efficient CPU designs 
and multi-cell processors.[[84]][270] While Kurzweil used Modis' resources, 
and Modis' work was around accelerating change, Modis distanced himself from 
Kurzweil's thesis of a "technological singularity", claiming that it lacks 
scientific rigor.[[81]][265]

Others propose that other "singularities" can be found through analysis of 
trends in [world population][271], world [gross domestic product][272], and 
other indices. [Andrey Korotayev][273] and others argue that historical [hyperbolic 
growth][274] curves can be attributed to [feedback loops][122] that ceased 
to affect global trends in the 1970s, and thus hyperbolic growth should not 
be expected in the future.[[85]][275][[86]][276]

In _The Progress of Computing_, [William Nordhaus][277] argued that, prior 
to 1940, computers followed the much slower growth of a traditional industrial 
economy, thus rejecting extrapolations of Moore's law to 19th-century computers. 
[Schmidhuber (2006][278]) suggests differences in memory of recent and distant 
events create an illusion of accelerating change, and that such phenomena may 
be responsible for past apocalyptic predictions.

Andrew Kennedy, in his 2006 paper for the [British Interplanetary Society][279] 
discussing [change and the growth in space travel velocities][280],[[87]][281] 
stated that although long-term overall growth is inevitable, it is small, embodying 
both ups and downs, and noted, "New technologies follow known laws of power 
use and information spread and are obliged to connect with what already exists. 
Remarkable theoretical discoveries, if they end up being used at all, play 
their part in maintaining the growth rate: they do not make its plotted curve... 
redundant." He stated that exponential growth is no predictor in itself, and 
illustrated this with examples such as [quantum theory][282]. The quantum was 
conceived in 1900, and quantum theory was in existence and accepted approximately 
25 years later. However, it took over 40 years for [Richard Feynman][283] and 
others to produce meaningful numbers from the theory. [Bethe][284] understood 
nuclear fusion in 1935, but 75 years later fusion reactors are still only used 
in experimental settings. Similarly, [quantum entanglement][285] was understood 
in 1935 but not at the point of being used in practice until the 21st century. 

A study of patents per thousand persons shows that human creativity does not 
show accelerating returns, but in fact, as suggested by [Joseph Tainter][286] 
in his seminal _The Collapse of Complex Societies_,[[88]][287] a law of [diminishing 
returns][288]. The number of patents per thousand peaked in the period from 
1850–1900, and has been declining since.[[82]][267] The growth of complexity 
eventually becomes self-limiting, and leads to a wide spread "general systems 
collapse". [Thomas Homer Dixon][289] in _[The Upside of Down: Catastrophe, 
Creativity and the Renewal of Civilization][290]_ maintains that the declining 
energy returns on investment has led to the collapse of civilizations.

In addition to general criticisms of the singularity concept, several critics 
have raised issues with Kurzweil's iconic chart. One line of criticism is that 
a [log-log][291] chart of this nature is inherently biased toward a straight-line 
result. Others identify selection bias in the points that Kurzweil chooses 
to use. For example, biologist [PZ Myers][292] points out that many of the 
early evolutionary "events" were picked arbitrarily.[[89]][293] Kurzweil has 
rebutted this by charting evolutionary events from 15 neutral sources, and 
showing that they fit a straight line on [a log-log chart][232]. _[The Economist][294]_ 
mocked the concept with a graph extrapolating that the number of blades on 
a razor, which has increased over the years from one to as many as five, will 
increase ever-faster to infinity.[[90]][295]

## 
[[edit][296]] In popular culture

See also: [List of fictional computers][297]

[Isaac Asimov][223]'s 1950 story "[The Evitable Conflict][298]", (the last 
part of the _[I, Robot][299]_ collection) features the Machines, four supercomputers 
managing the world's economy. The computers are incomprehensible to humans 
and are impossible to analyze for errors, having been created through 10 stages 
of [bootstrapping][300]. In the end of the story, it is implied that from now 
on (it occurs in 2052), no major conflict can occur, and the Machines are going 
to guide humanity toward a better future, one only they are capable of seeing 
(and know to truly be the best). [Susan Calvin][301] states that "For all time, 
all conflicts are finally evitable. Only the Machines, from now on, are inevitable!" 

[James P. Hogan][302]'s 1979 novel _The Two Faces of Tomorrow_ is an explicit 
description of what is now called the Singularity. An artificial intelligence 
system solves an excavation problem on the moon in a brilliant and novel way, 
but nearly kills a work crew in the process. Realizing that systems are becoming 
too sophisticated and complex to predict or manage, a scientific team sets 
out to teach a sophisticated computer network how to think more humanly. The 
story documents the rise of self-awareness in the computer system, the humans' 
loss of control and failed attempts to shut down the experiment as the computer 
desperately defends itself, and the computer intelligence reaching maturity. 

While discussing the singularity's growing recognition, Vernor Vinge wrote 
in 1993 that "it was the science-fiction writers who felt the first concrete 
impact." In addition to his own short story "Bookworm, Run!", whose protagonist 
is a chimpanzee with intelligence augmented by a government experiment, he 
cites [Greg Bear][303]'s novel _[Blood Music][304]_ (1983) as an example of 
the singularity in fiction. Vinge described surviving the singularity in his 
1986 novel _[Marooned in Realtime][111]_. Vinge later expanded the notion of 
the singularity to a galactic scale in _[A Fire Upon the Deep][112]_ (1992), 
a novel populated by transcendent beings, each the product of a different race 
and possessed of distinct agendas and overwhelming power.

In [William Gibson][305]'s 1984 novel _[Neuromancer][306]_, artificial intelligences 
capable of improving their own programs are strictly regulated by special "Turing 
police" to ensure they never exceed a certain level of intelligence, and the 
plot centers on the efforts of one such AI to circumvent their control. The 
1994 novel _[The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect][307]_ features an AI that 
augments itself so quickly as to gain low-level control of all matter in the 
universe in a matter of hours.

[William Gibson][305] and [Bruce Sterling][308]'s [alternate history][309] 
[Steampunk][310] novel _[The Difference Engine][311]_ ends with a vision of 
the singularity occurring in 1991 with a superintelligent computer that has 
merged its mind with the inhabitants of London.

A more malevolent AI achieves similar levels of omnipotence in [Harlan Ellison][312]'s 
short story _[I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream][313]_ (1967).

[William Thomas Quick][314]'s novels _Dreams of Flesh and Sand_ (1988), _Dreams 
of Gods and Men_ (1989), and _Singularities_ (1990) present an account of the 
transition through the singularity; in the last novel, one of the characters 
states that mankind's survival requires it to integrate with the emerging machine 
intelligences, or it will be crushed under the dominance of the machines – 
the greatest risk to the survival of a species reaching this point (and alluding 
to large numbers of other species that either survived or failed this test, 
although no actual contact with alien species occurs in the novels).

The singularity is sometimes addressed in fictional works to explain the event's 
absence. [Neal Asher][315]'s _[Gridlinked][316]_ series features a future where 
humans living in the Polity are governed by AIs and while some are resentful, 
most believe that they are far better governors than any human. In the fourth 
novel, _[Polity Agent][317]_, it is mentioned that the singularity is far overdue 
yet most AIs have decided not to partake in it for reasons that only they know. 
A flashback character in [Ken MacLeod][318]'s 1998 novel _The Cassini Division_ 
dismissively refers to the singularity as "the [Rapture][319] for nerds", though 
the singularity goes on to happen anyway.

Popular movies in which computers become intelligent and violently overpower 
the human race include _[Colossus: The Forbin Project][320]_, the _[Terminator][321]_ 
series, the very loose film adaptation of _[I, Robot][226]_, and _[The Matrix][322]_ 
series. The television series _[Battlestar Galactica][323]_ also explores these 
themes.

[Isaac Asimov][223] expressed ideas similar to a post-Kurzweilian singularity 
in his short story "[The Last Question][324]". Asimov's future envisions a 
reality where a combination of [strong artificial intelligence][325] and [post-humans][326] 
consume the cosmos, during a time Kurzweil describes as when "the universe 
wakes up", the last of his six stages of cosmic evolution as described in _[The 
Singularity is Near][129]_. Post-human entities throughout various time periods 
of the story inquire of the artificial intelligence within the story as to 
how [entropy death][327] will be avoided. The AI responds that it lacks sufficient 
information to come to a conclusion, until the end of the story when the AI 
does indeed arrive at a solution. Notably, it does so in order to fulfill its 
[duty][224] to answer the humans' question.

[St. Edward's University][328] chemist [Eamonn Healy][329] discusses accelerating 
change in the film _[Waking Life][330]_. He divides history into increasingly 
shorter periods, estimating "two billion years for life, six million years 
for the hominid, a hundred-thousand years for mankind as we know it". He proceeds 
to human cultural evolution, giving time scales of ten thousand years for agriculture, 
four hundred years for the scientific revolution, and one hundred fifty years 
for the industrial revolution. Information is emphasized as providing the basis 
for the new evolutionary paradigm, with artificial intelligence its culmination. 
He concludes we will eventually create "neohumans" which will usurp humanity’s 
present role in scientific and technological progress and allow the exponential 
trend of accelerating change to continue past the limits of human ability. 

Accelerating progress features in some science fiction works, and is a central 
theme in [Charles Stross][331]'s [_Accelerando_][332]. Other notable authors 
that address singularity-related issues include [Karl Schroeder][333], [Greg 
Egan][334], [Ken MacLeod][318], [Rudy Rucker][335], [David Brin][336], [Iain 
M. Banks][337], [Neal Stephenson][338], [Tony Ballantyne][339], [Bruce Sterling][308], 
[Dan Simmons][340], [Damien Broderick][123], [Fredric Brown][341], [Jacek Dukaj][342], 
[Stanislav Lem][343], [Nagaru Tanigawa][344], [Douglas Adams][345], [Michael 
Crichton][346] and [Ian McDonald][347].

The feature-length documentary film _[Transcendent Man][134]_ by [Barry Ptolemy][133] 
is based on Kurzweil and his book _The Singularity Is Near_. The film documents 
Kurzweil's quest to reveal what he believes to be mankind's destiny. Another 
documentary, _[Plug & Pray][348]_, focuses on the promise, problems and ethics 
of artificial intelligence and robotics, with [Joseph Weizenbaum][349] and 
Kurzweil as the main subjects of the film.[[91]][350]

In 2009, scientists at Aberystwyth University in Wales and the U.K's University 
of Cambridge designed a robot called Adam that they believe to be the first 
machine to independently discover new scientific findings.[[92]][351] Also 
in 2009, researchers at [Cornell][352] developed a computer program that extrapolated 
the laws of motion from a pendulum's swings.[[93]][353][[94]][354]

The web comic [Dresden Codak][355] deals with trans-humanistic themes and the 
singularity.

The plot of an episode of the TV program _[The Big Bang Theory][356]_ (season 4, 
episode 2, "The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification") revolves around the anticipated 
date of the coming Singularity.

The seventeenth episode of the sixth season of the TV sitcom Futurama, Benderama 
references Bender reaching the technological singularity and being able to 
infinitely produce smaller versions of himself to wreak havoc on the world. 

[Industrial][357]/[Steampunk][310] entertainer [Doctor Steel][358] weaves the 
concept of a technological singularity into his music and videos, even having 
a song entitled _The Singularity_. He has been interviewed on his views by 
the [Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies][359],[[95]][360] and has 
also authored a paper on the subject.[[96]][361][[97]][362]

In 2012, concept band [SOLA-MI][363], released "NEXUS (Original Motion Picture 
Soundtrack)," an album about the first waking machine.

In the sci-fi webseries [Sync][364], a [computer virus][365] takes over a computerized 
human and becomes a singularity.

The context for this statement is as follows: "we will be producing about 1026 
to 1029 cps of nonbiological computation per year in the early 2030s. This 
is roughly equal to our estimate for the capacity of all living biological 
human intelligence ... This state of computation in the early 2030s will not 
represent the Singularity, however, because it does not yet correspond to a 
profound expansion of our intelligence. By the mid-2040s, however, that one 
thousand dollars' worth of computation will be equal to 1026 cps, so the intelligence 
created per year (at a total cost of about $1012) will be about one billion 
times more powerful than all human intelligence today. That _will_ indeed represent 
a profound change, and it is for that reason that I set the date for the Singularity—representing 
a profound and disruptive transformation in human capability—as 2045."

op-ed, but he did use this phrase in the short story collection _Threats and 
Other Promises_ from 1988, writing in the introduction to his story "The Whirligig 
of Time" (p. 72): _Barring a worldwide catastrophe, I believe that technology 
will achieve our wildest dreams, and_ soon. _When we raise our own intelligence 
and that of our creations, we are no longer in a world of human-sized characters. 
At that point we have fallen into a technological "black hole," a technological

### 
[[edit][675]] Fiction

* 
[After Life][676] by Simon Funk uses a complex narrative structure to explore the relationships among uploaded minds in a technological singularity.
* 
[[Message Contains No Recognizable Symbols]][677] by [Bill Hibbard][204] is a story about a technological singularity subject to the constraint that natural human authors are unable to depict the actions and dialog of super-intelligent minds.
* Much of [Ben Goertzel's fiction][678] discusses a technological singularity.
* In "[The Turk][679]", an episode of the science fiction television series _[Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles][680]_, John tells his mother about the singularity, a point in time when machines will be able to build superior versions of themselves without the aid of humans.
* 
_[Accelerando][332]_ by [Charles Stross][331]

* 
_[Dresden Codak][355]_, a webcomic by Aaron Diaz, often contains plots relating to the singularity and [transhumanism][391], especially in the _[Hob][681]_ story arc
* 
[Endgame: Singularity][682] is an [open source][683] game where the player is AI, whose goal is to attain technological singularity/apotheosis.
